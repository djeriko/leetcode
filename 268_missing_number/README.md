#### ***Missing Number***

Level: Easy

Given an array containing n distinct in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range than is missing from the array.

***Example 1:***
```
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2

Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all nubmers are in the range [0, 3]. 2 is the missing the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

***Example 2:***
```
Input: nums = [9, 6, 4, 2, 3 , 5, 7, 0, 1]
Output: 8
```
